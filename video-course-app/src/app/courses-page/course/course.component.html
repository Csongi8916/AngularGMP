      <p>Learn about where you can find course descriptions, what information they include, how they work, and details
        about various components of a course description. Course descriptions report information about a university or
        college's classes. They're published both in course catalogs that outline degree requirements and in course
        schedules that contain descriptions for all courses offered during a particular semester.
